Contributing to Shapely
=======================

All contributions are subject to the [Code of
Conduct](https://github.com/shapely/shapely/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

If you spot a bug or have an idea for a feature, please [create an
issue](https://github.com/shapely/shapely/issues). For simple fixes or
features, you can [create a pull
request](https://github.com/shapely/shapely/pulls), but it is a good idea to
have discussion on an issue before sinking a lot of time into a pull request.

Shapely is a mature project and its primary needs are bug fixes and
documentation. New features and major refactoring will be welcomed cautiously
and slowly because the work of maintaining a new feature over the lifetime of
the project can be several times larger than the work of the initial
contribution. Please open a discussion about such work before starting.
