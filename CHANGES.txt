Changes
=======

1.8.5.post1 (2022-10-13)
------------------------

Packaging:

Wheels are provided for Python versions 3.6-3.11 and Cython 0.29.32 is used to
generate C extension module code.

1.8.5 (2022-10-12)
------------------

Packaging:

Python 3.11 wheels have been added to the matrix for all platforms.

Bug fixes:

- Assign _lgeos in the macos frozen app check, fixing a bug introduced in 1.8.2
  (#1528).
- An exception is now raised when nan is passed to buffer and parallel_offset,
  preventing segmentation faults (#1516).

1.8.4 (2022-08-17)
------------------

Bug fixes:

- The new c_geom_p type caused a regression and has been removed (#1487).

1.8.3 (2022-08-16)
------------------

Deprecations:

The STRtree class will be changed in 2.0.0 and will not be compatible with the
class in versions 1.8.x. This change obsoletes the deprecation announcement in
1.8a3 (below).

Packaging:

Wheels for 1.8.3 published on PyPI include GEOS 3.10.3.

Bug fixes:

- The signature for GEOSMinimumClearance has been corrected, fixing an issue
  affecting aarch64-darwin (#1480)
- Return and arg types have been corrected and made more strict for area,
  length, and distance properties.
- A new c_geom_p type has been created to replace c_void_p when calling GEOS
  functions (#1479).
- An incorrect polygon-line intersection (#1427) has been fixed in GEOS 3.10.3,
  which will be included in wheels published to PyPI.
- GEOS buffer parameters are now destroyed, fixing a memory leak (#1440).

1.8.2 (2022-05-03)
------------------

- Make Polygons and MultiPolygons closed by definition, like LinearRings.
  Resolves #1246.
- Perform frozen app check for GEOS before conda env check on macos as we
  already do on linux (#1301).
- Fix leak of GEOS coordinate sequence in nearest_points reported in #1098.

1.8.1.post1 (2022-02-17)
------------------------

This post-release addresses a defect in the 1.8.1 source distribution. No .c
files are included in the 1.8.1.post1 sdist and Cython is required to build and
install from source.

1.8.1 (2022-02-16)
------------------

Packaging:

Wheels for 1.8.1 published on PyPI include GEOS 3.10.2. This version is the
best version of GEOS yet. Discrepancies in behavior compared to previous
versions are considered to be improvements.

For the first time, we will publish wheels for macos_arm64 (see PR #1310).

Python version support:

Shapely 1.8.1 works with Pythons 3.6-3.10.

Bug fixes:

- Require Cython >= 0.29.24 to support Python 3.10 (#1224).
- Fix array_interface_base (#1235).

1.8.0 (2021-10-25)
------------------

This is the final 1.8.0 release. There have been no changes since 1.8rc2.

1.8rc2 (2021-10-19)
-------------------

Build:

A pyproject.toml file has been added to specify build dependencies for the
_vectorized and _speedups modules (#1128). To install shapely without these
build dependencies, use the features of your build tool that disable PEP 517
and 518 support.

Bug fixes:

- Part of PR #1042, which added a new primary GEOS library name to be searched
  for, has been reverted by PR #1201.

1.8rc1 (2021-10-04)
-------------------

Deprecations:

The almost_exact() method of BaseGeometry has been deprecated. It is confusing
and will be removed in 2.0.0. The equals_exact() method is to be used instead.

Bug fixes:

- We ensure that the _speedups module is always imported before _vectorized to
  avoid an unexplained condition on Windows with Python 3.8 and 3.9 (#1184).

1.8a3 (2021-08-24)
------------------

Deprecations:

The STRtree class deprecation warnings have been removed. The class in 2.0.0
will be backwards compatible with the class in 1.8.0.

Bug fixes:

- The __array_interface__ raises only AttributeError, all other exceptions are
  deprecated starting with Numpy 1.21 (#1173).
- The STRtree class now uses a pair of item, geom sequences internally instead
  of a dict (#1177).


1.8a2 (2021-07-15)
------------------

Python version support:

Shapely 1.8 will support only Python versions >= 3.6.

New features:

- The STRtree nearest*() methods now take an optional argument that
  specifies exclusion of the input geometry from results (#1115).
- A GeometryTypeError has been added to shapely.errors and is consistently
  raised instead of TypeError or ValueError as in version 1.7. For backwards
  compatibility, the new exception will derive from TypeError and Value error
  until version 2.0 (#1099).
- The STRtree class constructor now takes an optional second argument, a
  sequence of objects to be stored in the tree. If not provided, the sequence
  indices of the geometries will be stored, as before (#1112).
- The STRtree class has new query_geoms(), query_items(), nearest_geom(), and
  nearest_item() methods (#1112). The query() and nearest() methods remain as
  aliases for query_geoms() and nearest_geom().

Bug fixes:

- We no longer attempt to load libc to get the free function on Linux, but get
  it from the global symbol table.
- GEOS error messages printed when GEOS_getCoordSeq() is passed an empty
  geometry are avoided by never passing an empty geometry (#1134).
- Python's builtin super() is now used only as described in PEP 3135 (#1109).
- Only load conda GEOS dll if it exists (on Windows) (#1108).
- Add /opt/homebrew/lib to the list of directories to be searched for the GEOS
  shared library.
- Added new library search path to assist app creation with cx_Freeze.

1.8a1 (2021-03-03)
------------------

Shapely 1.8.0 will be a transitional version. There are a few bug fixes and new
features, but it is mainly about warning of the upcoming changes in 2.0.0.
Several more pre-releases before 1.8.0 are expected. See the migration guide
to Shapely 1.8 / 2.0 for more details on how to update your code
(https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/latest/migration.html).

Python version support:

Shapely 1.8 will support only Python versions >= 3.5 (#884).

Deprecations:

The following functions and geometry attributes and methods will be removed in
version 2.0.0.

- ops.cascaded_union
- geometry .empty()
- geometry .ctypes and .__array_interface__
- multi-part geometry .__len__
- setting custom attributes on geometry objects

Geometry objects will become immutable in version 2.0.0.

The STRtree class will be entirely changed in 2.0.0. The exact future API is
not yet decided, but will be decided before 1.8.0 is released.

Deprecation warnings will be emitted in 1.8a1 when any of these features are
used.

The deprecated .to_wkb() and .to_wkt() methods on the geometry objects have
been removed.

New features:

- Add a normalize() method to geometry classes, exposing the GEOSNormalize
  algorithm (#1090).
- Initialize STRtree with a capacity of 10 items per node (#1070).
- Load libraries relocated to shapely/.libs by auditwheel versions < 3.1 or
  relocated to Shapely.libs by auditwheel versions >= 3.1.
- shapely.ops.voronoi_diagram() computes the Voronoi Diagram of a geometry or
  geometry collection (#833, #851).
- shapely.validation.make_valid() fixes invalid geometries (#883)

Bug fixes:

- For pyinstaller we now handle the case of more than one GEOS library in the
  environment, such as when fiona and rasterio wheels are co-installed with
  shapely (#1071).
- The ops.split function now splits on touch to eliminate confusing
  discrepancies between results using multi and single part splitters (#1034).
- Several issues with duplication and order of vertices in ops.substring have
  been fixed (#1008).

Packaging:

- The wheels uploaded to PyPI will include GEOS 3.9.1.

1.7.1 (2020-08-20)
------------------

- ``STRtree`` now safely implements the pickle protocol (#915).
- Documentation has been added for ``minimum_clearance`` (#875, #874).
- In ``STRtree.__del__()`` we guard against calling ``GEOSSTRtree_destroy``
  when the lgeos module has already been torn down on exit (#897, #830).
- Documentation for the ``overlaps()`` method has been corrected (#920).
- Correct the test in ``shapely.geometry.base.BaseGeometry.empty()`` to
  eliminate memory leaks like the one reported in #745.
- Get free() not from libc but from the processes global symbols (#891),
  fixing a bug that manifests on OS X 10.15 and 10.16.
- Extracting substrings from complex lines has been made more correct (#848,
  #849).
- Splitting of complex geometries has been sped up by preparing the input
  geometry (#871).

------------------

New features:

- The buffer operation can now be single-sides (#806, #727).

Bug fixes:

- Add /usr/local/lib to the list of directories to be searched for the GEOS
  shared library (#795).
- ops.substring now returns a line with coords in end-to-front order when given
  a start position that is greater than the end position (#628).
- Implement ``__bool__()`` for geometry base classes so that ``bool(geom)``
  returns the logical complement of ``geom.is_empty`` (#754).
- Remove assertion on the number of version-like strings found in the GEOS
  version string. It could be 2 or 3.

1.7a2 (2019-06-21)
------------------

- Nearest neighbor search has been added to STRtree (#668).
- Disallow sequences of MultiPolygons as arguments to the MultiPolygon
  constructor, resolving #588.
- Removed vendorized `functools` functions previously used to support
  Python 2.5.

Bug fixes:

- Avoid reloading the GEOS shared library when using an installed binary wheel
  on OS X (#735), resolving issue #553.
- The shapely.ops.orient function can now orient multi polygons and geometry
  collections as well as polygons (#733).

  sequences of x, y sequences (#732).
- The exterior of an empty polygon is now equal to an empty linear ring (#731).
- The bounds property of an empty point object now returns an empty tuple,
  consistent with other geometry types (#723).
- Segmentation faults when non-string values are passed to the WKT loader are
  avoided by #700.
- Failure of ops.substring when the sub linestring coincides with the beginning
  of the linestring has been fixed (#658).
- Segmentation faults from interpolating on an empty linestring are prevented
  by #655.
- A missing special case for rectangular polygons has been added to the

- LinearRing can be created from a LineString (#638).
- The prepared geometry validation condition has been tightened in #632 to fix
  the bug reported in #631.
- Attempting to interpolate an empty geometry no longer results in a
  segmentation fault, raising `ValueError` instead (#653).

1.7a1 (2018-07-29)
------------------

New features:

- A Python version check is made by the package setup script. Shapely 1.7
  supports only Python versions 2.7 and 3.4+ (#610).
- Added a new `EmptyGeometry` class to support GeoPandas (#514).
- Added new `shapely.ops.substring` function (#459).
- Added new `shapely.ops.clip_by_rect` function (#583).
- Use DLLs indicated in sys._MEIPASS' to support PyInstaller frozen apps
  (#523).
- `shapely.wkb.dumps` now accepts an `srid` integer keyword argument to write

  getter (#581, #594).

1.6.4.post1 (2018-01-24)
------------------------

- Fix broken markup in this change log, which restores our nicely formatted
  readme on PyPI.

1.6.4 (2018-01-24)
------------------

- Handle a ``TypeError`` that can occur when geometries are torn down (#473,
  #528).


1.6.3 (2017-12-09)
------------------

- AttributeError is no longer raised when accessing __geo_interface__ of an
  empty polygon (#450).
- ``asShape`` now handles empty coordinates in mappings as ``shape`` does
  (#542). Please note that ``asShape`` is likely to be deprecated in a future
  version of Shapely.
- Check for length of LineString coordinates in speed mode, preventing crashes
  when using LineStrings with only one coordinate (#546).

1.6.2 (2017-10-30)
------------------

- A 1.6.2.post1 release has been made to fix a problem with macosx wheels
  uploaded to PyPI.

1.6.2 (2017-10-26)
------------------

- Splitting a linestring by one of its end points will now succeed instead of
  failing with a ``ValueError`` (#524, #533).
- Missing documentation of a geometry's ``overlaps`` predicate has been added
  (#522).

1.6.1 (2017-09-01)
------------------

- Avoid ``STRTree`` crashes due to dangling references (#505) by maintaining
  references to added geometries.
- Reduce log level to debug when reporting on calls to ctypes ``CDLL()`` that
  don't succeed and are retried (#515).
- Clarification: applications like GeoPandas that need an empty geometry object
  should use ``BaseGeometry()`` instead of ``Point()`` or ``Polygon()``. An
  ``EmptyGeometry`` class has been added in the master development branch and
  will be available in the next non-bugfix release.

1.6.0 (2017-08-21)
------------------

Shapely 1.6.0 adds new attributes to existing geometry classes and new
functions (``split()`` and ``polylabel()``) to the shapely.ops module.
Exceptions are consolidated in a shapely.errors module and logging practices
have been improved. Shapely's optional features depending on Numpy are now
gathered into a requirements set named "vectorized" and these may be installed
like ``pip install shapely[vectorized]``.

Much of the work on 1.6.0 was aimed to improve the project's build and
packaging scripts and to minimize run-time dependencies. Shapely now vendorizes
packaging to use during builds only and never again invokes the geos-config
utility at run-time.

In addition to the changes listed under the alpha and beta pre-releases below,
the following change has been made to the project:

- Project documentation is now hosted at 
  https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.

Thank you all for using, promoting, and contributing to the Shapely project.

1.6b5 (2017-08-18)
------------------

Bug fixes:

- Passing a single coordinate to ``LineString()`` with speedups disabled now
  raises a ValueError as happens with speedups enabled. This resolves #509.

1.6b4 (2017-02-15)
------------------

Bug fixes:

- Isolate vendorized packaging in a _vendor directory, remove obsolete
  dist-info, and remove packaging from project requirements (resolves #468).

------------------

Bug fixes:

- Level for log messages originating from the GEOS notice handler reduced from
  WARNING to INFO (#447).

Packaging:

- Put Numpy in an optional requirement set named "vectorized" (#431).

1.6a2 (2016-11-09)
------------------

Bug fixes:

- Shapely no longer configures logging in ``geos.py`` (#415).

Refactoring:

- Consolidation of exceptions in ``shapely.errors``.
- ``UnsupportedGEOSVersionError`` is raised when GEOS < 3.3.0 (#407).

Packaging:

- Added new library search paths to assist Anaconda (#413).
- geos-config will now be bypassed when NO_GEOS_CONFIG env var is set. This
  allows configuration of Shapely builds on Linux systems that for whatever
  reasons do not include the geos-config program (#322).

1.6a1 (2016-09-14)
------------------

New features:

- A new error derived from NotImplementedError, with a more useful message, is
  raised when the GEOS backend doesn't support a called method (#216).
- The ``project()`` method of LineString has been extended to LinearRing
  geometries (#286).
- A new ``minimum_rotated_rectangle`` attribute has been added to the base
  geometry class (#354).
- A new ``shapely.ops.polylabel()`` function has been added. It
  computes a point suited for labeling concave polygons (#395).
- A new ``shapely.ops.split()`` function has been added. It splits a
  geometry by another geometry of lesser dimension: polygon by line, line by
  point (#293, #371).
- ``Polygon.from_bounds()`` constructs a Polygon from bounding coordinates
  (#392).
- Support for testing with Numpy 1.4.1 has been added (#301).

  objects (#397, #404).

Refactoring:

- Switch from ``SingleSidedBuffer()`` to ``OffsetCurve()`` for GEOS >= 3.3
  (#270).
- Cython speedups are now enabled by default (#252).

Packaging:

- Packaging 16.7, a setup dependency, is vendorized (#314).
- Infrastructure for building manylinux1 wheels has been added (#391).

  (#343).

1.5.17 (2016-08-31)
-------------------

-------------------
- Bug fix: eliminate memory leak when unpickling geometry objects (#384, #385).
- Bug fix: prevent crashes when attempting to pickle a prepared geometry,
  raising ``PicklingError`` instead (#386).
- Packaging: extension modules in the OS X wheels uploaded to PyPI link only
  libgeos_c.dylib now (you can verify and compare to previous releases with
  ``otool -L shapely/vectorized/_vectorized.so``).

1.5.15 (2016-03-29)
-------------------
- Bug fix: use uintptr_t to store pointers instead of long in _geos.pxi,
  preventing an overflow error (#372, #373). Note that this bug fix was
  erroneously reported to have been made in 1.5.14, but was not.

1.5.14 (2016-03-27)
-------------------
- Bug fix: use ``type()`` instead of ``isinstance()`` when evaluating geometry
  equality, preventing instances of base and derived classes from 
  being mistaken for equals (#317).
- Bug fix: ensure that empty geometries are created when constructors have no
  args (#332, #333).
- Bug fix: support app "freezing" better on Windows by not relying on the
  ``__file__`` attribute (#342, #377).
- Bug fix: ensure that empty polygons evaluate to be ``==`` (#355).
- Bug fix: filter out empty geometries that can cause segfaults when creating
  and loading STRtrees (#345, #348).
- Bug fix: no longer attempt to reuse GEOS DLLs already loaded by Rasterio
  or Fiona on OS X (#374, #375).

1.5.13 (2015-10-09)
-------------------
- Restore setup and runtime discovery and loading of GEOS shared library to
  state at version 1.5.9 (#326).
- On OS X we try to reuse any GEOS shared library that may have been loaded
  via import of Fiona or Rasterio in order to avoid a bug involving the

1.5.11 (2015-08-23)
-------------------
- Remove packaging module requirement added in 1.5.10 (#305). Distutils can't 
  parse versions using 'rc', but if we stick to 'a' and 'b' we will be fine.

1.5.10 (2015-08-22)
-------------------
- Monkey patch affinity module by absolute reference (#299).
- Raise TopologicalError in relate() instead of crashing (#294, #295, #303).
