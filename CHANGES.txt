Changes
=======

1.6b3 (2016-12-31)
------------------

Bug fixes:

- Level for log messages originating from the GEOS notice handler reduced from
  WARNING to INFO (#447).
- Permit speedups to be imported again without Numpy (#444).

1.6b2 (2016-12-12)
------------------

New features:

- Add support for GeometryCollection to shape and asShape functions (#422).

1.6b1 (2016-12-12)
------------------

Bug fixes:

- Implemented __array_interface__ for empty Points and LineStrings (#403).

1.6a3 (2016-12-01)
------------------

Bug fixes:

- Remove accidental hard requirement of Numpy (#431).

Packaging:

- Put Numpy in an optional requirement set named "vectorized" (#431).

1.6a2 (2016-11-09)
------------------

Bug fixes:

- Shapely no longer configures logging in ``geos.py`` (#415).

Refactoring:

- Consolidation of exceptions in ``shapely.errors``.
- ``UnsupportedGEOSVersionError`` is raised when GEOS < 3.3.0 (#407).

Packaging:

- Added new library search paths to assist Anaconda (#413).
- geos-config will now be bypassed when NO_GEOS_CONFIG env var is set. This
  allows configuration of Shapely builds on Linux systems that for whatever
  reasons do not include the geos-config program (#322).

1.6a1 (2016-09-14)
------------------

New features:

- A new error derived from NotImplementedError, with a more useful message, is
  raised when the GEOS backend doesn't support a called method (#216).
- The ``project()`` method of LineString has been extended to LinearRing
  geometries (#286).
- A new ``minimum_rotated_rectangle`` attribute has been added to the base
  geometry class (#354).
- A new ``shapely.ops.polylabel()`` function has been added. It
  computes a point suited for labeling concave polygons (#395).
- A new ``shapely.ops.split()`` function has been added. It splits a
  geometry by another geometry of lesser dimension: polygon by line, line by
  point (#293, #371).
- ``Polygon.from_bounds()`` constructs a Polygon from bounding coordinates
  (#392).
- Support for testing with Numpy 1.4.1 has been added (#301).
- Support creating all kinds of empty geometries from empty lists of Python
  objects (#397, #404).

Refactoring:

- Switch from ``SingleSidedBuffer()`` to ``OffsetCurve()`` for GEOS >= 3.3
  (#270).
- Cython speedups are now enabled by default (#252).

Packaging:

- Packaging 16.7, a setup dependency, is vendorized (#314).
- Infrastructure for building manylinux1 wheels has been added (#391).
- The system's ``geos-config`` program is now only checked when ``setup.py``
  is executed, never during normal use of the module (#244).
- Added new library search paths to assist PyInstaller (#382) and Windows
  (#343).

1.5.17 (2016-08-31)
-------------------
- Bug fix: eliminate memory leak in geom_factory() (#408).
- Bug fix: remove mention of negative distances in parallel_offset and note
  that vertices of right hand offset lines are reversed (#284).

1.5.16 (2016-05-26)
-------------------
- Bug fix: eliminate memory leak when unpickling geometry objects (#384, #385).
- Bug fix: prevent crashes when attempting to pickle a prepared geometry,
  raising ``PicklingError`` instead (#386).
- Packaging: extension modules in the OS X wheels uploaded to PyPI link only
  libgeos_c.dylib now (you can verify and compare to previous releases with
  ``otool -L shapely/vectorized/_vectorized.so``).

1.5.15 (2016-03-29)
-------------------
- Bug fix: use uintptr_t to store pointers instead of long in _geos.pxi,
  preventing an overflow error (#372, #373). Note that this bug fix was
  erroneously reported to have been made in 1.5.14, but was not.

1.5.14 (2016-03-27)
-------------------
- Bug fix: use ``type()`` instead of ``isinstance()`` when evaluating geometry
  equality, preventing instances of base and derived classes from 
  being mistaken for equals (#317).
- Bug fix: ensure that empty geometries are created when constructors have no
  args (#332, #333).
- Bug fix: support app "freezing" better on Windows by not relying on the
  ``__file__`` attribute (#342, #377).
- Bug fix: ensure that empty polygons evaluate to be ``==`` (#355).
- Bug fix: filter out empty geometries that can cause segfaults when creating
  and loading STRtrees (#345, #348).
- Bug fix: no longer attempt to reuse GEOS DLLs already loaded by Rasterio
  or Fiona on OS X (#374, #375).

1.5.13 (2015-10-09)
-------------------
- Restore setup and runtime discovery and loading of GEOS shared library to
  state at version 1.5.9 (#326).
- On OS X we try to reuse any GEOS shared library that may have been loaded
  via import of Fiona or Rasterio in order to avoid a bug involving the
  GEOS AbstractSTRtree (#324, #327).

1.5.12 (2015-08-27)
-------------------
- Remove configuration of root logger from libgeos.py (#312).

1.5.11 (2015-08-23)

  parse versions using 'rc', but if we stick to 'a' and 'b' we will be fine.

1.5.10 (2015-08-22)
-------------------
- Monkey patch affinity module by absolute reference (#299).
