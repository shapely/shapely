Background
==========

Shapely is a package for programming with geospatial geometries. It is based on
the GEOS_ library, a port of the `Java Topology Suite`_. Please refer to the
JTS overview for definitions and illustrations of the various geometry types,
operations, and predicates. See also the Shapely wiki_ and Python Package Index
record_.

Geometries
==========

The basic, standard GIS geometry model consists of single points, line strings,
and polygons, homogeneous multi-point, multi-line string, and multi-polygon
collections, and heterogeneous geometry collections. See the JTS illustration_.

.. _illustration: http://www.jump-project.org/project.php?PID=JTS&SID=OVER#spatialdatatypes

Shapely 1.0 does not provide circles, arcs, splines or the like. Shapely 1.0
does it provide heterogeneous geometry collections.

Factories
---------

Geometries can be created in the typical Python fashion, using the geometry
classes themselves as factories.

Pseudo-code blocks in this section will use the following notation. Let **a**
be a Cartesian *x*, *y*, and optional *z* coordinate sequence. The coordinates
values must be numeric types. Let (**a**\ 1, ..., **a**\ M) and (**b**\ 1, ...,
**b**\ N) be ordered sequences of *M* and *N* such coordinate sequences,
defining lines or rings.

Points
++++++

The point factory *Point* takes a coordinate sequence parameter

.. code-block:: python

  >>> from shapely.geometry import Point
  >>> point = Point(a)

The alternate form is to pass individual coordinate parameters

.. code-block:: python

  >>> point = Point(x0, y0 [, z0])

LineStrings
+++++++++++

To create a line string, pass in an ordered sequence of coordinate sequences:

.. code-block:: python

  >>> from shapely.geometry import LineString
  >>> line = LineString((a1, ..., aM))

Polygons
++++++++

A polygon with only an exterior boundary and no holes is created by passing the sequence representation of a closed ring

.. code-block:: python

  >>> from shapely.geometry import Polygon
  >>> polygon = Polygon((a1, ..., aM))

If **a**\ 1 is not exactly equal to **a**\ M, the factory will close the ring.
The following (unit square) polygons are therefore topologically equal

.. code-block:: python

  >>> polygon1 = Polygon(((0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 0), (0, 0)))
  >>> polygon2 = Polygon(((0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 0)))
  
To create a polygon with interior boundaries pass a sequence of rings to the
second parameter (*holes*)

.. code-block:: python

  >>> polygon = Polygon((a1, ..., aM), [(b1, ..., bN), ...])

Multipart Geometry Factories
----------------------------

MultiPoints
+++++++++++

An *N*\ -point geometry is created by passing an unordered sequence of
coordinate sequences [**c**\ 1, ..., **c**\ N]

.. code-block:: python

  >>> from shapely.geometry import MultiPoint
  >>> points = MultiPoint([c1, ..., cN])

MultiLineStrings
++++++++++++++++

A multi-line geometry is created by passing a sequence of representations of
lines

.. code-block:: python

  >>> from shapely.geometry import MultiLineString
  >>> lines = MultiLineString([(a1, ..., aM), (b1, ..., bN), ...])

MultiPolygons
+++++++++++++

A multi-polygon geometry is created by passing a sequence of exterior ring and
hole list tuples 

.. code-block:: python

  >>> from shapely.geometry import MultiPolygon
  >>> lines = MultiPolygon([((a1, ..., aM), [(b1, ..., bN), ...]), ...])

More explicit notation for the exterior and interior boundaries (or shells and
holes) makes usage more clear

.. code-block:: python

  >>> shell = (a1, ..., aM)
  >>> holes = [(b1, ..., bN), ...]
  >>> lines = MultiPolygon([(shell, holes), ...])

Constructive Spatial Analysis Methods
-------------------------------------

There are methods of geometry classes that also serve as factories for new
geometries. It is important to note that these are topological and not
point-wise operations, and therefore may produce results that are not what one
might expect from operations on Python sets.

Example Geometries
++++++++++++++++++

.. code-block:: python

  >>> polygon = Polygon(((-1.0, -1.0), (-1.0, 1.0), (1.0, 1.0), (1.0, -1.0)))
  >>> point_r = Point(-1.5, 1.2)
  >>> point_g = Point(-1.0, 1.0)
  >>> point_b = Point(-0.5, 0.5)
  >>> line_r = LineString(((-0.5, 0.5), (0.5, 0.5)))
  >>> line_g = LineString(((1.0, -1.0), (1.8, 0.5)))
  >>> line_b = LineString(((-1.8, -1.2), (1.8, 0.5)))

Buffer
++++++

.buffer(distance, quadsegs=16) : geometry
  Buffers the geometry by a unitless *distance*. The *quadsegs* parameter is
  the number of segments per quadrant in resulting geometries. The default
  result of buffering a point is a 66-gon approximation of a circle:

.. code-block:: python

  >>> buffered = point_r.buffer(1.0)
  >>> buffered
  <shapely.geometry.polygon.Polygon object at ...>
  >>> buffered.length
  6.2806623139097271
  >>> buffered.area
  3.1365484905463727
  >>> len(buffered.exterior.coords)
  66

Boundary
++++++++

.boundary : geometry
  Returns a lower dimension geometry. The boundary of a polygon is a line, the
  boundary of a line is a collection of points. The boundary of a point is an
  empty (null) collection.

.. code-block:: python

  >>> polygon.boundary
  <shapely.geometry.linestring.LineString object at ...>
  >>> line_b.boundary
  <shapely.geometry.multipoint.MultiPoint object at ...>
  >>> point_r.boundary.is_empty
  True

Centroid
++++++++

.centroid : geometry
  Returns the centroid, or geometric center of the polygon.

.. code-block:: python

  >>> centroid_point = polygon.centroid
  >>> centroid_point.wkt
  'POINT (-0.0000000000000000 -0.0000000000000000)'


Convex Hull
+++++++++++

.convex_hull : geometry
  Imagine an elastic band stretched around the geometry: that's a convex hull,
  more or less.

For example, collect the three points into a multi-point geometry, and get the
triangular polygon that is their convex hull:

.. code-block:: python

  >>> multi_point = point_r.union(point_g)
  >>> multi_point = multi_point.union(point_b)
  >>> multi_point.convex_hull
  <shapely.geometry.polygon.Polygon object at ...>

Difference
++++++++++

.difference(other) : geometry
  Returns the difference of one geometry from the *other* geometry. Note that
  A.difference(B) is not equal to B.difference(A).

.. code-block:: python

  >>> hull = multi_point.convex_hull
  >>> polygon.difference(hull)
  <shapely.geometry.polygon.Polygon object at ...>

Intersection
++++++++++++

.intersection(other) : geometry
  Returns the intersection of one geometry and the *other* geometry.

.. code-block:: python

  >>> polygon.intersection(hull)
  <shapely.geometry.polygon.Polygon object at ...>

Symmetric Difference
++++++++++++++++++++

.symmetric_difference(other) : geometry
  Returns the symmetric difference of one geometry from the *other* geometry.

.. code-block:: python

  >>> polygon.symmetric_difference(hull)
  <shapely.geometry.multipolygon.MultiPolygon object at ...>

Union
+++++

.union(other) : geometry
  Returns the union of one geometry and the *other* geometry.

Point unions were demonstrated above under convex hull. The union of polygons
will be a polygon or a multi-polygon depending on whether they intersect or
not:

.. code-block:: python

  >>> hull.union(polygon)
  <shapely.geometry.polygon.Polygon object at ...>

Unary Spatial Predicates
------------------------

These are implemented as Python attributes.

Is Empty
++++++++

.is_empty : bool
  True if the set of points in this geometry is empty, else False. For more
  details, see
  http://geos.refractions.net/ro/doxygen_docs/html/classgeos_1_1geom_1_1Geometry.html#a17.  

Is Valid
++++++++

.is_valid : bool
  True if the geometry is valid (definition depends on sub-class), else False.
  For more details, see
  http://geos.refractions.net/ro/doxygen_docs/html/classgeos_1_1geom_1_1Geometry.html#a16.

Is Ring
+++++++

.is_ring : bool
  True if the geometry is a closed ring, else False.

Has Z
+++++

.has_z : bool
  True if the geometry's coordinate sequence(s) have z values (are
  3-dimensional)

Examples
++++++++

.. code-block:: python

  >>> polygon.is_empty
  False
  >>> polygon.is_valid
  True
  >>> polygon.is_ring
  False
  >>> polygon.boundary.is_ring
  True
  >>> polygon.has_z
  True

(Note: that last return value exposes a bug in GEOS 2.2.3. Should be False.)

Binary Spatial Predicates
-------------------------

All of these methods take a single positional argument, an *other* geometry. It
is important to note that these are topological and not point-wise operations,
and therefore may produce results that are not what one might expect from
operations on Python.

Contains
++++++++

.contains(other) : bool
  True if the geometry is spatially within, without touching. Applies to all
  types of geometries.

.. code-block:: python

  >>> polygon.contains(point_b)
  True

Crosses
+++++++

.crosses(other) : bool
  Only linear geometries (lines, rings, polygon boundaries) may ever cross. No
  geometry may ever cross a point.

.. code-block:: python

  >>> line_b.crosses(polygon)
  True

Disjoint
++++++++

.disjoint(other) : bool
  True if geometries do not spatially relate in any way, else False. See the
  complementary *intersects*. 

.. code-block:: python

  >>> polygon.disjoint(point_r)
  True

Equals
++++++

.equals(other) : bool
  Two geometries are topologically equal if their interiors intersect and no
  part of the interior or boundary of one geometry intersects the exterior of
  the other [1]. Not to be confused with Python's *__equals__*.

Intersects
++++++++++

.intersects(other) : bool
  This predicate is the complement of *disjoint*: geometries that do not
  intersect are disjoint. Intersects is the most inclusive predicate.

.. code-block:: python

  >>> polygon.intersects(point_b)
  True

Touches
+++++++

.touches(other) : bool
  True if geometries *only* touch. The least inclusive predicate.

.. code-block:: python

  >>> polygon.touches(line_g)
  True
  >>> polygon.touches(line_b)
  False

Within
++++++

.within(other): bool
  The inverse of *contains*.
