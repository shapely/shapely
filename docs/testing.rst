Testing
=======

The functions in this module are not directly importable from the root ``shapely`` module.
Instead, import them from the submodule as follows:

  >>> from shapely.testing import assert_geometries_equal

.. automodule:: shapely.testing
   :members:
   :exclude-members:
   :special-members:
   :inherited-members:
   :show-inheritance:
