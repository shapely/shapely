Introduction
============

Deterministic spatial analysis is an important component of computational
approaches to problems in agriculture, ecology, epidemiology, sociology, and
many other fields. What is the surveyed perimeter/area ratio of these patches
of animal habitat? Which properties in this town intersect with the 50-year
flood contour from this new flooding model? What are the extents of findspots
for ancient ceramic wares with maker's marks "A" and "B", and where do the
extents overlap? These are just a few of the possible questions addressable
using non-statistical spatial analysis, and more specifically, computational
geometry.

Shapely is a Python package for set-theoretic analysis and manipulation of
planar features using (via Python's `ctypes` module) functions from the well
known and widely deployed GEOS_ library. GEOS, a port of the `Java Topology
Suite`_, is the geometry engine of the PostGIS_ spatial extension for the
PostgreSQL RDBMS. The designs of JTS and GEOS are largely guided by the `Open
Geospatial Consortium`_'s Simple Features Access Specification [1]_ and Shapely
adheres mainly to the same set of standard classes and operations. Shapely is
deeply rooted in the geographic information systems (GIS) world, but aspires to
be equally useful to programmers working on non-tradtional problems.

PostGIS is a cornerstone of open source GIS, but isn't necessarily a solution
to all problems in the GIS domain. Not all geographic data originate or reside
in a RDBMS or are best processed using SQL. Shapely aims to bring industrial
strength computational geometry primitives to bear on programming problems
better addressed in a object-oriented style. Imagine a situation where we would
like to find or index a substring within another string. Is there overlap
between the strings, and if so, what is it?  Or maybe we'd like to replace
certain characters in a string with others. Now imagine that we're compelled to
load the text strings from, say, a log file into a relational database to
perform these operations because such string functions aren't available in a
non-SQL context. No knock on the RDBMS, a tremendously useful thing, but if
there's no mandate to manage (the "M" in "RDBMS") these strings over time in
the database, we're using the wrong tool for the job in this imaginary
scenario. Now, consider spatial entities like points, curves, and patches
instead of character strings, and that they might originate not in the context
of a traditional GIS, but from parsing and geocoding of texts or log files or
from "social web" activities. If you agree that sometimes PostGIS (or another
spatially-enabled RDBMS) is the wrong tool for your computational geometry job,
Shapely might be for you.

One of the premises of Shapely is that Python programmers should be able to
perform PostGIS type geometry operations outside of an RDBMS.  Another is that
Python idioms trump GIS (or Java, in this case, since the GEOS library is
derived from JTS, a Java project) idioms. Shapely, in a nutshell lets you do
PostGIS-y stuff with geometries outside the context of a database using
idiomatic Python. Computational geometry, in the cartesian plane, with no extra
baggage.

Spatial Data Model
------------------

The fundamental types of geometric objects implemented by Shapely are points,
curves, and surfaces. Each is associated with three sets of (possibly infinite)
points in the plane. The `interior`, `boundary`, and `exterior` sets of a
feature are mutually exclusive and their union coincides with the entire plane
[2]_.

* A `Point` has an `interior` set of exactly one point, a `boundary` set of
  exactly no points, and an `exterior` set of all other points. A `Point` has
  a topological dimension of 0.

* A `Curve` has an `interior` set consisting of the infinitely many points
  along its length (imagine a `Point` dragged in space), a `boundary` set
  consisting of its two end points, and an `exterior` set of all other points.
  A `Curve` has a topological dimension of 1. 

* A `Surface` has an `interior` set consisting of the infinitely many points
  within (imagine a `Curve` dragged in space to cover an area), a `boundary`
  set consisting of one or more `Curves`, and an `exterior` set of all other
  points including those within holes that might exist in the surface. A
  `Surface` has a topological dimension of 2.

That may seem a bit esoteric, but will help clarify the meanings of Shapely's
spatial predicates, and it's as deep into theory as this manual will go.
Consequences of point-set theory, including some that manifest themselves as
"gotchas", for different classes will be discussed later in this manual.

The point type is implemented by a `Point` class; curve by the `LineString` and
`LinearRing` classes; and surface by a `Polygon` class. Shapely implements no
smooth (`i.e.` having continuous tangents) curves. All curves must be
approximated by linear splines. All rounded patches must be approximated by
regions bounded by linear splines.

Collections of points are implemented by a `MultiPoint` class, collections of
curves by a `MultiLineString` class, and collections of surfaces by a
`MultiPolygon` class. These collections aren't computationally significant, but
are useful for modeling certain kinds of features. A Y-shaped line feature, for
example, is well modeled as a whole by a `MultiLineString`.

The standard data model has additional constraints specific to certain types
of geometric objects that will be discussed in following sections of this
manual.

See also http://www.vividsolutions.com/jts/discussion.htm#spatialDataModel
for more illustrations of this data model.

Relationships
-------------

The spatial data model is accompanied by a group of natural language
relationships between geometric objects – `contains`, `intersects`, `overlaps`,
`touches`, etc – and a theoretical framework for understanding them using the
3x3 matrix of the mutual intersections of their component point sets [2]_: the
DE-9IM. A comprehensive review of the relationships in terms of the DE-9IM is
found in [4]_ and will not be reiterated in this manual.

Operations
----------

Following the JTS technical specs [5]_, this manual will make a distinction
between constructive (`buffer`, `convex hull`) and set-theoretic operations
(`intersection`, `union`, etc). The individual operations will be fully
described in a following section of the manual.

Coordinate Systems
------------------

Even though the Earth is not flat – and for that matter not exactly spherical –
there are many analytic problems that can be approached by transforming Earth
features to a Cartesian plane, applying tried and true algorithms, and then
transforming the results back to geographic coordinates.  This practice is as
old as the tradition of accurate paper maps.

Shapely does not support coordinate system transformations. All operations on
two or more features presume that the features exist in the same Cartesian
plane.

Geometric Objects
=================

Geometric objects are created in the typical Python fashion, using the classes
themselves as instance factories. A few of their intrinsic properties will be
discussed in this sections, others in the following sections on operations and
serializations. 

Instances of `Point`, `LineString`, and `LinearRing` have as their most
important attribute a finite sequence of coordinates that determines their
interior, boundary, and exterior point sets. A line string can be determined by
as few as 2 points, but contains an infinite number of points. Coordinate
sequences are immutable. Their parent features are mutable in that they can be
assigned new coordinate sequences. A third `z` coordinate value may be used
when constructing instances, but has no effect on geometric analysis.  All
operations are performed in the `x-y` plane.

In all constructors, numeric values are converted to type `float`. In other
words, ``Point(0, 0)`` and ``Point(0.0, 0.0)`` produce geometrically equivalent
instances. Shapely does not check the topological simplicity or validity of
instances when they are constructed as the cost is unwarranted in most cases.
Validating factories are trivially implemented, using the `is_valid` predicate,
by users that require them.

Pseudo-code blocks in this section will use the following notation. Let `a` be
a point in Cartesian coordinates, represented by a Python tuple of 2 (``(x,
y)``) or 3 (``(x, y, z)``) numerical values. Let `(a1, ..., aM)` and `(b1, ...,
bN)` be ordered sequences of `M` and `N` such points, defining the vertices of
a `curve`.

Points
------

The `Point` constructor takes positional coordinate values or point tuple
parameters.

.. sourcecode:: pycon

  >>> from shapely.geometry import Point
  >>> point = Point(0.0, 0.0)
  >>> q = Point((0.0, 0.0))

A `Point` has zero area and zero length.

.. sourcecode:: pycon

  >>> point.area
  0.0
  >>> point.length
  0.0

Its `x-y` bounding box is a ``(minx, miny, maxx, maxy)`` tuple.

.. sourcecode:: pycon

  >>> point.bounds
  (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)

Coordinate values are accessed via `coords`, `x`, `y`, and `z` properties.

.. sourcecode:: pycon

  >>> list(point.coords)
  [(0.0, 0.0)]
  >>> point.x
  0.0
  >>> point.y
  0.0

The `Point` constructor also accepts another `Point` instance, thereby making
a copy.

.. sourcecode:: pycon

  >>> Point(point)
  <shapely.geometry.point.Point object at 0x...>
  
LineStrings
-----------

The `LineString` constructor takes an ordered sequence of 2 or more point
tuples. The constructed `LineString` object represents one or more connected
linear splines between the points.

.. sourcecode:: pycon

  >>> from shapely.geometry import LineString
  >>> line = LineString((a1, ..., aM))

Repeated points in the ordered sequence are allowed, but may incur performance
penalties and should be avoided. A `LineString` may cross itself (*i.e.* be
`complex` and not `simple`).

.. plot:: code/linestring.py

Figure 1: a simple `LineString` on the left, a complex `LineString` on the
right. The (`MultiPoint`) boundary of each is shown in black, the other points
that describe the lines are shown in grey.

A `LineString` has zero area and non-zero length.

.. sourcecode:: pycon

  >>> line = LineString([(0, 0), (1, 1)])
  >>> line.area
  0.0
  >>> line.length
  1.4142135623730951

Its `x-y` bounding box is a ``(minx, miny, maxx, maxy)`` tuple.

.. sourcecode:: pycon

  >>> line.bounds
  (0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0)

The defining coordinate values are accessed via the `coords` property.

.. sourcecode:: pycon

  >>> len(line.coords)
  2
  >>> list(line.coords)
  [(0.0, 0.0), (1.0, 1.0)]

The constructor also accepts another `LineString` instance, thereby making a
copy.

.. sourcecode:: pycon

  >>> LineString(line)
  <shapely.geometry.linestring.LineString object at 0x...>

A sequence of `Point` instances is not a valid constructor parameter. A
`LineString` is described by points, but is not composed of `Point` instances.

LinearRings
-----------

The `LinearRing` constructor takes an ordered sequence of point tuples. The
sequence may be explicitly closed by passing identical values in the first and
last indices. Otherwise, the sequence will be implicitly closed by copying the
first tuple to the last index.

.. sourcecode:: pycon

  >>> from shapely.geometry.polygon import LinearRing
  >>> ring = LinearRing((a1, ..., aM))

Repeated points in the ordered sequence are allowed, but may incur performance
penalties and should be avoided. A `LinearRing` may not cross itself, and may
not touch itself at a single point. Note that Shapely will not prevent the
creation of such rings, but exceptions will be raised when they are operated
on.

.. plot:: code/linearring.py

Figure 1: a valid `LinearRing` on the left, an invalid self-touching
`LinearRing` on the right. The points that describe the rings are shown in
grey. A ring's boundary is `empty`.

A `LinearRing` has zero area and non-zero length.

.. sourcecode:: pycon

  >>> ring = LinearRing([(0, 0), (1, 1), (1, 0)])
  >>> ring.area
  0.0
  >>> ring.length
  3.4142135623730949

Its `x-y` bounding box is a ``(minx, miny, maxx, maxy)`` tuple.

.. sourcecode:: pycon

  >>> ring.bounds
  (0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0)

Defining coordinate values are accessed via the `coords` property.

.. sourcecode:: pycon

  >>> len(ring.coords)
  4
  >>> list(ring.coords)
  [(0.0, 0.0), (1.0, 1.0), (1.0, 0.0), (0.0, 0.0)]

The `LinearRing` constructor also accepts another `LineString` or `LinearRing`
instance, thereby making a copy.

.. sourcecode:: pycon

  >>> LinearRring(ring)
  <shapely.geometry.polygon.LinearRing object at 0x...>
  
As with `LineString`, a sequence of `Point` instances is not a valid
constructor parameter.

Polygons
--------

The `Polygon` constructor takes two positional parameters. The first is an
ordered sequence of point tuples and is treated exactly as in the `LinearRing`
case. The second is an optional unordered sequence of ring-like sequences
specifying the interior boundaries or "holes" of the feature.

.. sourcecode:: pycon

  >>> from shapely.geometry import Polygon
  >>> polygon = Polygon((a1, ..., aM), [(b1, ..., bN), ...])

Rings of a `valid` `Polygon` may not cross each other, but may touch at a
single point only.  Again, Shapely will not prevent the creation of invalid
features, but exceptions will be raised when they are operated on.

.. plot:: code/polygon.py

Figure 1: On the left, a valid `Polygon` with one interior ring that touches
the exterior ring at one point, and on the right a `Polygon` that is `invalid`
because its interior ring touches the exterior ring at more than one point. The
points that describe the rings are shown in grey.

.. plot:: code/polygon2.py

Figure 1: On the left, a `Polygon` that is `invalid` because its exterior and
interior rings touch along a line, and on the right, a `Polygon` that is
`invalid` because its interior rings touch along a line.

A `Polygon` has non-zero area and non-zero length.

.. sourcecode:: pycon

  >>> polygon = Polygon([(0, 0), (1, 1), (1, 0)])
  >>> polygon.area
  0.5
  >>> polygon.length
  3.4142135623730949

Its `x-y` bounding box is a ``(minx, miny, maxx, maxy)`` tuple.

.. sourcecode:: pycon

  >>> polygon.bounds
  (0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0)

Component rings are accessed via `exterior` and `interiors` properties.

.. sourcecode:: pycon

  >>> list(polygon.exterior.coords)
  [(0.0, 0.0), (1.0, 1.0), (1.0, 0.0), (0.0, 0.0)]
  >>> list(polygon.interiors)
  []

The `Polygon` constructor also accepts instances of `LineString` and
`LinearRing`.

.. sourcecode:: pycon

  >>> coords = [(0, 0), (1, 1), (1, 0)]
  >>> r = LinearRing(coords)
  >>> s = Polygon(r)
  >>> s.area
  0.5  
  >>> t = Polygon(s.buffer(1.0).exterior, [r])
  >>> t.area
  6.5507620529190334

MultiPoints
-----------

The `MultiPoint` constructor takes an ordered sequence of point tuples.

.. sourcecode:: pycon

  >>> from shapely.geometry import MultiPoint
  >>> points = MultiPoint([c1, ..., cN])

A `MultiPoint` has zero area and zero length.

.. sourcecode:: pycon

  >>> points = MultiPoint([(0.0, 0.0), (1.0, 1.0)])
  >>> points.area
  0.0
  >>> points.length
  0.0

Its `x-y` bounding box is a ``(minx, miny, maxx, maxy)`` tuple.

.. sourcecode:: pycon

  >>> points.bounds
  (0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0)

Members of a multi-point collection are accessed via the `geoms` property.

.. sourcecode:: pycon

  >>> import pprint
  >>> pprint.pprint(list(points.geoms))
  [<shapely.geometry.point.Point object at 0x...>,
   <shapely.geometry.point.Point object at 0x...>]

The constructor also accepts another `MultiPoint` instance or an unordered
sequence of `Point` instances, thereby making copies.

.. sourcecode:: pycon

  >>> MultiPoint([Point(0, 0), Point(1, 1)])
  <shapely.geometry.multipoint.MultiPoint object at 0x...>

MultiLineStrings
----------------

The `MultiLineString` constructor takes an unordered sequence of line-like
sequences.

.. sourcecode:: pycon

  >>> from shapely.geometry import MultiLineString
  >>> lines = MultiLineString([(a1, ..., aM), (b1, ..., bN), ...])

.. plot:: code/multilinestring.py

Figure 1: On the left, a `simple`, disconnected `MultiLineString`, and on the
right, a non-simple `MultiLineString`.

A `MultiLineString` has zero area and non-zero length.

.. sourcecode:: pycon

  >>> coords = [((0, 0), (1, 1)), ((-1, 0), (1, 0))]
  >>> lines = MultiLineString(coords)
  >>> lines.area
  0.0
  >>> lines.length
  3.4142135623730949

Its `x-y` bounding box is a ``(minx, miny, maxx, maxy)`` tuple.

.. sourcecode:: pycon

  >>> lines.bounds
  (-1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0)

Its members are instances of `LineString` and are accessed via the `geoms`
property.

.. sourcecode:: pycon

  >>> len(lines.geoms)
  2
  >>> pprint.pprint(list(lines.geoms))
  [<shapely.geometry.linestring.LineString object at 0x...>,
   <shapely.geometry.linestring.LineString object at 0x...>]
  
The constructor also accepts another instance of `MultiLineString` or an unordered sequence of `LineString` instances, thereby making copies.

.. sourcecode:: pycon

  >>> MultiLineString(lines)
  <shapely.geometry.multilinestring.MultiLineString object at 0x...>
  >>> MultiLineString(lines.geoms)
  <shapely.geometry.multilinestring.MultiLineString object at 0x...>

MultiPolygons
-------------

The `MultiPolygon` constructor takes a sequence of exterior ring and
hole list tuples.

.. sourcecode:: pycon

  >>> from shapely.geometry import MultiPolygon
  >>> polygons = MultiPolygon([((a1, ..., aM), [(b1, ..., bN), ...]), ...])

More explicit notation for the exterior and interior boundaries (or shells and
holes) makes usage more clear.

.. sourcecode:: pycon

  >>> shell = (a1, ..., aM)
  >>> holes = [(b1, ..., bN), ...]
  >>> polygons = MultiPolygon([(shell, holes), ...])

Perhaps even more clearly, the constructor accepts an unordered sequence of
`Polygon` instances, thereby making copies.

.. sourcecode:: pycon

  >>> polygons = MultiPolygon([polygon, s, t])
  >>> len(polygons.geoms)
  3

.. plot:: code/multipolygon.py

Figure 1: blah, blah.

Its `x-y` bounding box is a ``(minx, miny, maxx, maxy)`` tuple.

.. sourcecode:: pycon

  >>> polygons.bounds
  (-1.0, -1.0, 2.0, 2.0)

Empty features
--------------

An "empty" feature is one with a point set that coincides with the empty set:
not a ``None``, but like ``()``. Empty features can be created by calling the
constructors with no arguments.  Almost no operations are supported by empty
features.

.. sourcecode:: pycon

  >>> line = LineString()
  >>> line.is_empty
  True
  >>> line.length
  0.0
  >>> line.bounds
  ()

The coordinates of a empty feature can be set, after which the geometry is no
longer empty.

.. sourcecode:: pycon

  >>> line.coords = [(0, 0), (1, 1)]
  >>> line.is_empty
  False
  >>> line.length
  1.4142135623730951
  >>> line.bounds
  (0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0)

Predicates
==========

Shapely features provide standard [1]_ predicate properties and methods. All
return `True` or `False`.

Unary Predicates
----------------

Standard unary predicates are implemented as instance properties.

**has_z**: Returns `True` if the feature has not only `x` and `y`, but also `z`
coordinates.

.. sourcecode:: pycon

  >>> Point(0, 0).has_z
  False
  >>> Point(0, 0, 0).has_z
  True

**is_empty**: Returns `True` if the feature's `interior` and
`boundary` (in point set terms) coincide with the empty set.

.. sourcecode:: pycon

  >>> Point().is_empty
  True
  >>> Point(0, 0).is_empty
  False

**is_ring**: Returns `True` if the feature is closed. A closed feature's
`boundary` coincides with the empty set. Applicable to `LineString` and
`LinearRing`. This predicate is somewhat redundant considering that closed-ness
is in practice a class attribute.

.. sourcecode:: pycon

  >>> LineString([(0, 0), (1, 1), (1, -1)]).is_ring
  False
  >>> LinearRing([(0, 0), (1, 1), (1, -1)]).is_ring
  True

**is_simple**: Returns `True` if the feature does not cross itself. Operations
on non-simple `LineStrings` are fully supported by Shapely. 

.. sourcecode:: pycon

  >>> LineString([(0, 0), (1, 1), (1, -1), (0, 1)]).is_simple
  False

**is_valid**: Returns `True` if a feature is "valid" in the sense of [1]_. A
valid `LinearRing` may not cross itself or touch itself at a single point. A
valid `Polygon` may not possess any overlapping exterior or interior rings. A
valid `MultiPolygon` may not collect any overlapping polygons. Operations on
invalid features may fail.

.. sourcecode:: pycon

  >>> MultiPolygon([Point(0, 0).buffer(2.0), Point(1, 1).buffer(2.0)]).is_valid
  False

The two points above are close enough that the polygons resulting from the
buffer operations (explained in a following section) overlap.

The `is_valid` predicate could be used to write a decorator that ensures only
valid objects are returned from a function.

.. sourcecode:: python

  def valid_ring(coordinates):
      ring = LinearRing(coordinates)
      if not ring.is_valid:
          raise TopologicalError(
              "Given coordinates do not determine a valid LinearRing")
      return ring

An exception is raised when the function is passed the self-crossing
coordinates from the `is_simple` example above.

.. sourcecode:: pycon

  >>> coords = [(0, 0), (1, 1), (1, -1), (0, 1)]
  >>> valid_ring(coords)
  Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    File "<stdin>", line 5, in valid_ring
  shapely.geos.TopologicalError: Given coordinates do not determine a valid LinearRing

This might also be done using a decorator.

.. sourcecode:: python

  from functools import wraps
  def validate(func):
      @wraps(func)
      def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
          ob = func(*args, **kwargs)
          if not ob.is_valid:
              raise TopologicalError(
                  "Given arguments do not determine a valid geometric object")
          return ob
      return wrapper

.. sourcecode:: pycon

  >>> @validate
  ... def ring(coordinates):
  ...     return LinearRing(coordinates)
  ... 
  >>> ring(coords)
  Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    File "<stdin>", line 7, in wrapper
  shapely.geos.TopologicalError: Given arguments do not determine a valid geometric object

Binary Predicates
-----------------

Standard binary predicates are implemented as instance methods. These
predicates evaluate topological, set-theoretic relationships. In a few cases
the results may not be what one might expect.  All take another geometric
object as argument and return `True` or `False`.

**contains** (other): Returns `True` if the object's `interior` contains the
`boundary` and `interior` of the other object and their boundaries do not touch
at all. This predicate applies to all types, and is inverse to `within`:
``a.contains(b) == b.within(a)`` always evaluates to ``True``.

.. sourcecode:: pycon

  >>> coords = [(0, 0), (1, 1)]
  >>> LineString(coords).contains(Point(0.5, 0.5))
  True
  >>> Point(0.5, 0.5).within(LineString(coords))
  True

A line's endpoints are part of its `boundary` and are therefore not contained.

.. sourcecode:: pycon

  >>> LineString(coords).contains(Point(1.0, 1.0))
  False

**crosses** (other): Returns `True` if the `interior` of the object intersects
the `interior` of the other but does not contain it, and the dimension of the
intersection is less than the dimension of the one or the other.

.. sourcecode:: pycon

  >>> LineString(coords).crosses(LineString([(0, 1), (1, 0)]))
  True

A line does not cross a point that it contains.

.. sourcecode:: pycon

  >>> LineString(coords).crosses(Point(0.5, 0.5))
  False

**disjoint** (other): Returns `True` if the `boundary` and `interior` of the
object do not intersect at all with those of the other. This predicate applies
to all types and is the inverse of `intersects`.

.. sourcecode:: pycon

  >>> Point(0, 0).disjoint(Point(1, 1))
  True

**equals** (other): Returns `True` if the set-theoretic `boundary`, `interior`,
and `exterior` of the object coincide with those of the other. The coordinates
passed to the object constructors are of these sets, and determine them, but
are not the entirety of the sets. This is a potential "gotcha" for new users.
Equivalent lines, for example, can be constructed differently:

.. sourcecode:: pycon

  >>> a = LineString([(0, 0), (1, 1)])
  >>> b = LineString([(0, 0), (0.5, 0.5), (1, 1)])
  >>> c = LineString([(0, 0), (0, 0), (1, 1)])
  >>> a.equals(b)
  True
  >>> b.equals(c)
  True

This predicate should not be mistaken for Python's ``==`` or ``is``
constructions.

**intersects** (other): Returns `True` if the `boundary` and `interior` of the
object intersect in any way with those of the other. It is the super-relation
of `contains`, `crosses`, `equals`, `touches`, and `within`.

**touches** (other): Returns `True` if the `boundary` of the object intersects
only the `boundary` of the other, and their interiors do not intersect with any
part of the other. Overlapping features do not therefore "touch", another
potential "gotcha".

For example, the following lines touch at `(1, 1)`, but do not overlap.

.. sourcecode:: pycon

  >>> a = LineString([(0, 0), (1, 1)])
  >>> b = LineString([(1, 1), (2, 2)])
  >>> a.touches(b)
  True

**within** (other): Returns `True` if the object's `boundary` and `interior`
intersect only with the `interior` of the other (not its `boundary` or
`exterior`).This applies to all types and is the inverse of `contains`.

Constructive Methods
====================

Shapely geometric object have several methods that yield new objects not
derived from their point sets. TODO: improve this.

Buffering
---------

**buffer** (distance, quadsegs=16): Returns a new object that contains,
approximately, all points within a given `distance` of the original object. A
positive distance has an effect of dilation; a negative distance, erosion. The
optional `quadsegs` argument determines the number of segements used to
approximate a quarter circle around a point. 

.. sourcecode:: pycon

  >>> line = LineString([(0, 0), (1, 1), (0, 2), (2, 2), (3, 1), (1, 0)])
  >>> dilated = line.buffer(0.5)
  >>> eroded = dilated.buffer(-0.3)

.. plot:: code/buffer.py

Figure 1. Dilation of a line (left) and erosion of a polygon (right). New
object is shown in blue.

The default buffer of a point is a polygonal patch with 99.8% of the area of
the disk it approximates.

.. sourcecode:: pycon

  >>> p = Point(0, 0).buffer(10.0)
  >>> len(p.exterior.coords)
  66
  >>> p.area
  313.65484905459385

With a `quadsegs` value of 1, the buffer is a square patch.

.. sourcecode:: pycon

  >>> q = Point(0, 0).buffer(10.0, 1)
  >>> len(q.exterior.coords)
  5
  >>> q.area
  200.0

Passed a `distance` of 0, `buffer` can be used to "clean" self-touching
polygons such as the classic "bowtie".

.. sourcecode:: pycon

  >>> coords = [(0, 0), (0, 2), (1, 1), (2, 2), (2, 0), (1, 1), (0, 0)]
  >>> bowtie = Polygon(coords)
  >>> bowtie.is_valid
  False
  >>> clean = bowtie.buffer(0)
  >>> clean.is_valid
  True
  >>> clean
  <shapely.geometry.multipolygon.MultiPolygon object at ...>
  >>> len(clean)
  2
  >>> list(clean[0].exterior.coords)
  [(0.0, 0.0), (0.0, 2.0), (1.0, 1.0), (0.0, 0.0)]
  >>> list(clean[1].exterior.coords)
  [(1.0, 1.0), (2.0, 2.0), (2.0, 0.0), (1.0, 1.0)]

Buffering splits the polygon in two at the point where they touch.

Convex Hull
-----------

**convex_hull**: Returns the smallest convex `Polygon` containing all the
points in the object unless the number of points in the object is less than
three. For two points, the convex hull collapses to a `LineString`; for 1, a
`Point`.

.. |hullcode| replace:: code

Simplification
--------------

**simplify** (tolerance, preserve_topology=True): Returns a simplified version
of the geometric object. All points in the simplified object will be within the
`tolerance` distance of the original geometry. By default a slower algorithm is
used that preserves topology. If preserve topology is set to False the much
quicker Douglas-Peucker algorithm (TODO: cite) is used, and invalid geometries
may result.

   tolerance of 0.1 (left) and 0.5 (right). [|simplifycode|_]

  >>> x = p.buffer(1.0)
  >>> x.area
  3.1365484905459389
  >>> len(x.exterior.coords)
  66
  >>> s = x.simplify(0.05, preserve_topology=False)
  >>> s.area
  3.0614674589207187
  >>> len(s.exterior.coords)
  17

Set-Theoretic Methods
=====================

TODO: Finish sections below this.

Boundary
--------

.boundary : geometry
  Returns a lower dimension geometry. The boundary of a polygon is a line, the
  boundary of a line is a collection of points. The boundary of a point is an
  empty (null) collection.

.. sourcecode:: python

  >>> polygon.boundary
  <shapely.geometry.linestring.LineString object at ...>
  >>> line_b.boundary
  <shapely.geometry.multipoint.MultiPoint object at ...>
  >>> point_r.boundary.is_empty
  True

Difference
----------

.difference(other) : geometry
  Returns a geometry representing the points making up this geometry that do
  not make up *other*. Note that A.difference(B) is not necessarily equal to
  B.difference(A).

.. sourcecode:: python

  >>> hull = multi_point.convex_hull
  >>> polygon.difference(hull)
  <shapely.geometry.polygon.Polygon object at ...>

Envelope
--------

.envelope : geometry
  Returns the geometry's rectangular polygon envelope.

.. sourcecode:: python

  >>> polygon.envelope
  <shapely.geometry.polygon.Polygon object at ...>

Intersection
------------

.intersection(other) : geometry
  Returns the intersection of one geometry and the *other* geometry.

.. sourcecode:: python

  >>> polygon.intersection(hull)
  <shapely.geometry.polygon.Polygon object at ...>

Symmetric Difference
--------------------

.symmetric_difference(other) : geometry
  Returns a geometry combining the points in this geometry not in *other*, and
  the points in *other* not in this geometry.

.. sourcecode:: python

  >>> polygon.symmetric_difference(hull)
  <shapely.geometry.multipolygon.MultiPolygon object at ...>

Union
-----

.union(other) : geometry
  Returns the union of one geometry and the *other* geometry.

Point unions were demonstrated above under convex hull. The union of polygons
will be a polygon or a multi-polygon depending on whether they intersect or
not:

.. sourcecode:: python

  >>> hull.union(polygon)
  <shapely.geometry.polygon.Polygon object at ...>


Other Operations
================

Polygonization
--------------

shapely.ops.polygonize(lines) : iterator
  Returns an iterator over polygons constructed from the *lines* iterator. The
  elements of *lines* may be Shapely geometries, objects that provide the geo
  interface, or Numpy arrays or Python sequences shaped like LineStrings.

.. sourcecode:: python

  >>> from shapely.ops import polygonize
  >>> lines = [
  ...     ((0, 0), (1, 1)),
  ...     ((0, 0), (0, 1)),
  ...     ((0, 1), (1, 1)),
  ...     ((1, 1), (1, 0)),
  ...     ((1, 0), (0, 0))
  ...     ]
  >>> result = polygonize(lines)
  >>> list(result.geoms)
  [<shapely.geometry.polygon.Polygon object at ...>, <shapely.geometry.polygon.Polygon object at ...>]

Line merging
------------

shapely.ops.linemerge(lines) : iterator or MultiLineString
  Merges all connected lines. Returns a LineString or MultiLineString when
  lines are not contiguous. 

.. sourcecode:: python

  >>> lines = MultiLineString([ 
  ...     ((0, 0), (1, 1)), 
  ...     ((2, 0), (2, 1), (1, 1)) 
  ...     ]) 
  >>> result = linemerge(lines)
  >>> result # docstring: +ELLIPSIS
  <shapely.geometry.linestring.LineString object at 0x...>


General Methods
===============

Distance
--------

.distance(other) : geometry
  The minimum distance from one geometry to the other.

.. sourcecode:: python

  >>> Point(0,0).distance(Point(1,1))
  1.4142135623730951

Interoperation
==============

Shapely provides 4 avenues for interoperation with other Python and GIS
software.

Well-known Formats
------------------

Well-known Text (WKT)
+++++++++++++++++++++

The WKT representation of any geometry object can be had via the **wkt**
attribute:

.. sourcecode:: python

  >>> point_r.wkt
  'POINT (-1.5000000000000000 1.2000000000000000)'

Hex-encode that string and you have a value that can be conveniently inserted directly into PostGIS

.. sourcecode:: python

  >>> point_r.wkt.encode('hex')
  '504f494e5420282d312e3530303030303030303030303030303020312e3230303030303030303030303030303029'

New geometries can be created from WKT representations using the
*shapely.wkt.loads* factory (inspired by the *pickle* module) 

.. sourcecode:: python

  >>> from shapely.wkt import loads
  >>> loads('POINT (0 0)')
  <shapely.geometry.point.Point object at ...>

Well-known Binary (WKB)
+++++++++++++++++++++++

The WKB representation of any geometry object can be had via the **wkb**
attribute. New geometries can be created from WKB data using the
*shapely.wkb.loads* factory. Use this format to interoperate with ogr.py:

.. sourcecode:: python

  >>> import ogr
  >>> from shapely.wkb import loads
  >>> source = ogr.Open("/tmp/world_borders.shp")
  >>> borders = source.GetLayerByName("world_borders")
  >>> feature = borders.GetNextFeature()
  >>> loads(feature.GetGeometryRef().ExportToWkb())
  <shapely.geometry.polygon.Polygon object at ...>

Numpy Array Interface
---------------------

Shapely geometries provide the Numpy array interface which means that points,
line strings, and polygon rings can be used as Numpy arrays:

.. sourcecode:: python

  >>> from numpy import array
  >>> a = array(polygon.exterior)
  >>> a
  array([[-1., -1.],
         [-1.,  1.],
         [ 1.,  1.],
         [ 1., -1.],
         [-1., -1.]])

The *numpy.asarray* function does not copy coordinate values at the price of
slower numpy access to coordinates.

The *shapely.geometry.as\** functions can also be used to wrap numpy arrays,
which can then be analyzed using Shapely while maintaining their original
storage. A 1 x 2 array can be adapted to a point

.. sourcecode:: python

  >>> a = array([1.0, 2.0])
  >>> pa = asPoint(a)
  >>> pa.wkt
  'POINT (1.0000000000000000 2.0000000000000000)'

and a N x 2 array can be adapted to a line string

.. sourcecode:: python

  >>> from shapely.geometry import asLineString
  >>> a = array([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]])
  >>> la = asLineString(a)
  >>> la.wkt
  'LINESTRING (1.0000000000000000 2.0000000000000000, 3.0000000000000000 4.0000000000000000)'

There is no Numpy array representation of a polygon.


Python Geo Interface
--------------------

Any object that provides the GeoJSON-like `Python geo interface`_ can be
adapted and used as a Shapely geometry using the *shapely.geometry.asShape*
function. For example, a dictionary:

.. sourcecode:: python

  >>> from shapely.geometry import asShape
  >>> d = {"type": "Point", "coordinates": (0.0, 0.0)}
  >>> shape = asShape(d)
  >>> shape.geom_type
  'Point'
  >>> list(shape.coords)
  [(0.0, 0.0)]

Or a simple placemark-type object:

.. sourcecode:: python

  >>> class GeoThing(object):
  ...     def __init__(self, d):
  ...         self.__geo_interface__ = d
  >>> thing = GeoThing({"type": "Point", "coordinates": (0.0, 0.0)})
  >>> shape = asShape(thing)
  >>> shape.geom_type
  'Point'
  >>> list(shape.coords)
  [(0.0, 0.0)]

If you want to copy coordinate data to a new geometry, use the
*shapely.geometry.shape* function instead.

Advanced Features
=================

Iterative Operations
--------------------

Shapely provides functions for efficient operations on large sets of
geometries.

Contains
++++++++

To find the subset of points that are contained within a polygon, use
*shapely.iterops.contains*:

.. sourcecode:: python

  >>> from shapely.geometry import Polygon
  >>> from shapely.geometry import Point
  >>> coords = ((0.0, 0.0), (0.0, 1.0), (1.0, 1.0), (1.0, 0.0), (0.0, 0.0))
  >>> polygon = Polygon(coords)
  >>> points = [Point(0.5, 0.5), Point(2.0, 2.0)]  
  >>> from shapely import iterops  
  >>> list(iterops.contains(polygon, points, True))
  [<shapely.geometry.point.Point object at ...>]

The second parameter to *iterops.contains* can be any kind of iterator, even a
generator of objects. If it yields tuples, then the second element of the tuple
will be ultimately yielded from *iterops.contains*.

.. sourcecode:: python

  >>> list(iterops.contains(polygon, iter((p, p.wkt) for p in points)))
  ['POINT (0.5000000000000000 0.5000000000000000)']

Prepared Geometry Operations
----------------------------

Shapely geometries can be pre-analyzed into a state that supports more
efficient batches of operations. To test one polygon containment against a
large batch of points, one should first use the `prepared.prep` function:

.. sourcecode:: python

  >>> from shapely.geometry import Point
  >>> from shapely.prepared import polyprep
  >>> points = [...] # large list of points
  >>> polygon = Point(0.0, 0.0).buffer(1.0)
  >>> prepared_polygon = prep(polygon)
  >>> prepared_polygon
  <shapely.prepared.PreparedGeometry object at ...>
  >>> hits = filter(prepared_polygon.contains, points)

Prepared geometries instances have the following methods: ``contains``,
``contains_properly``, ``covers``, and ``intersects``. All have exactly the
same arguments and usage as their counterparts in the standard geometries.
